            <h1> <b> The 3 best League of Legends teams of 2020 </b></h1> <br> <br>
            <b> BY Jason Smith, DECEMBER 1 2021<br> <br> </b>
            <pre class="paragraf">
                Many industries across the world had to quickly adjust to the dangerous circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic—and 
                the League of Legends esports scene was no exception.And yet there were some rosters that persevered through the 
                difficulties and uncertainty. Some teams adapted and became even better iterations of themselves all to win.
            
                Here are the three best League teams of 2020: <br><br>
            <b>DAMWON Gaming</b><br>
                It should come as no surprise that the 2020 world champions are featured on this list. 
                After their performance in the second half of the year, DAMWON etched their name into the history 
                books as one of the most dominant rosters we’ve seen in a long time. <br>
                <b>Suning</b> <br>
                Suning were an underdog in most of the matchups they faced, especially in the knockout stage. 
                Whether it was JDG, Top Esports, or DAMWON, many people thought that the LPL third seed would get eliminated.
                But during Worlds, they bested both of them in a best-of-five setting by only losing one game to each. <br>
                <b>G2 Esports</b> <br>
                With a powerful core comprised of some of the best players in the region, the team stumbled a surprising amount of times, 
                including playoff losses to MAD Lions and Fnatic and a third-place finish during the 2020 Summer Split regular season.
                Their Worlds 2020 run started off great, with the team tying Suning for first place in Group A with a 4-2 record. 
                They also beat Gen.G in a convincing sweep but were eventually taken down by DAMWON in four games.
